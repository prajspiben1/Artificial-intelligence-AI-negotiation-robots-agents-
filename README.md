# Artificial-intelligence-AI-negotiation-robots-agents-
Artificial intelligence (AI) negotiation robots(agents) that can operate on behalf of the buyers and sellers to locate potential deals, automatically and anonymously negotiate towards the best terms for their respective users based on the parameters set by the  users to be important and also based on market conditions.
# About my idea 
* The AI negotiation agents join a multi-stage negotiation session just like how humans discuss in meetings until sufficiently improved offers are obtained for particular products and services.
* These negotiated, improved, offers are then transmitted to the buyers and sellers for acceptance.
* Server-implemented framework that automates the discovery and negotiation of product sales online based on buyer- and seller-defined parameters and elasticity thresholds.
* The AI agent for Sellers optimizes sales strategy and effectiveness while the AI agent for Buyers improves purchasing decision-making and empowers better deals with less effort.
# How current drawbacks in society can be solved by my project
* Customers need not waste their time searching for good deals on the internet such as Amazon,flipkart since  the artificial intelligence(AI) robots(agents) will be able to operate on behalf of the buyers and sellers to locate potential deals, automatically and anonymously negotiate towards the best terms for their respective users based on the parameters set by the users to be important and also based on market conditions.
* Server-implemented framework that automates the discovery and negotiation of product sales online based on buyer- and seller-defined parameters and elasticity thresholds which saves a lot of time.
* consumers making purchasing product decisions often deal with information overload, market noise, pricing gaps, and conflicting product-review signals but with AI robots joining a multiple negotiation stage together and finally giving the best potential deals to consumers,hence consumers wonâ€™t have any confusions in their decisions.
* The AI agent for Sellers optimizes sales strategy and effectiveness while the AI agent for Buyers improves purchasing decision-making and empowers better deals with less effort.
* Retailers have to check on salesmen and ensure that they are collecting information about what customers want in order to better target and promote their offerings,but with the implementation of AI robots they need not spend time ensuring and checking on salesmen.
* Business executives need not attend business deals and spend time to negotiate it according to their preference ,since AI bots will be able to do all these work and business executives can tend to do more important tasks at office.
